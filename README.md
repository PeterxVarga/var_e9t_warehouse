# Warehouse robot route optimization with ROS 2

Order-picking route optimization and replanning for a simulated warehouse mobile robot.

## Goal

The robot completes pickup jobs on a known aisle network and returns to the depot. The project examines route length and replanning after an aisle closure. Route length and robot execution time are evaluated separately.

## Planned features

- Warehouse layout, depot, and pickup jobs with unique identifiers.
- Comparison of FIFO, nearest-neighbor, and 2-opt pickup sequences.
- Robot motion and job execution with ROS 2 state feedback.
- Replanning from the current robot position after an aisle closure.
- Warehouse visualization, routes, job states, and measurement logs.
- Exact reference solutions for small cases and comparative evaluation for larger cases.

## Status

The container environment has passed the headless runtime checks. Robot simulation, route-planning code, and experimental results will be added as development progresses.

## Development environment

The environment uses ROS 2 Humble and Gazebo Fortress on Ubuntu 22.04.
The container workflow below is tested with rootless Podman on Linux/amd64.

### Build the image

Run from the repository root:

```bash
podman build -f Containerfile -t localhost/var-e9t-warehouse:humble .
```

### Open the workspace

```bash
podman run --rm -it \
  --name var-e9t-warehouse-ros \
  --volume "$PWD:/workspace:Z" \
  localhost/var-e9t-warehouse:humble
```

The repository is mounted at `/workspace`. On SELinux hosts, `:Z` gives
this dedicated container access to the mounted directory. Exit the shell
to remove the container; source files remain on the host.

The image entrypoint loads ROS 2. Check the available tools inside the container:

```bash
printenv ROS_DISTRO
colcon --help
ign gazebo --versions
ros2 pkg prefix ros_gz_bridge
ros2 pkg prefix ros_gz_sim
```

### Open another terminal

While the workspace container is running:

```bash
podman exec -it var-e9t-warehouse-ros bash
```

Load ROS 2 in that new shell:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
```

No project package is included yet. Build and simulation launch commands
will be added with the first working robot simulation.

and [Podman run](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-run.1.html).

Tested versions: ROS 2 Humble, Ubuntu 22.04, Gazebo Fortress 6.18.0,
ROS/Gazebo bridge and simulator packages 0.244.26, and Podman 5.8.4.

Validation covered a headless Gazebo server with an advancing ROS `/clock`,
cross-process ROS 2 message transfer, workspace writes, a second shell,
and a fresh container restart. GUI setup follows with the robot simulation.
